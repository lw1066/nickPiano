        <h2>Tuning</h2>
        <p>
          Pianos are under a huge amount of pressure due to the tension of the
          strings and can go out of tune even if not played much, changes in
          humidity also affect the tuning. A twice yearly tuning is recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          I charge Â£85 for a tuning and any running repairs. Please leave up to
          3 hours per appointment.
        </p>
        <h2>Regulation</h2>I offer a regulation service for upright and grand
        pianos. Please contact me for further details.
