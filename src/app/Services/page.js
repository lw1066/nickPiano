        <h2>Tuning</h2>
        <p>
          Pianos are under a huge amount of pressure due to the tension of the
          strings and can go out of tune even if not played much, changes in
          humidity also affect the tuning. A twice yearly tuning is recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          I charge Â£85 for a tuning and any running repairs. Please leave up to
          3 hours per appointment.
        </p>
        <h2>Cleaning and regulation</h2>
        <p>
          Cleaning and making necessary adjustments to the inner mechanism of
          the piano is important as this compensates for any wear and changes in
          wooden parts due to humidity.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          I offer a regulation service for uprights and grands which will give
          your instrument a new lease of life. Please contact for further
          details.
